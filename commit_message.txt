Feat: Implement chat/news improvements and fix icon glow

This commit introduces several enhancements based on user feedback:

1.  **Icon Glow Animation:** The CSS keyframe animation for the typing indicator icon in `index.html` has been refined. It now uses a `drop-shadow` filter with no offset to create a more precise glow effect that emanates directly from the non-transparent parts of the icon, fixing the "square glow" issue.

2.  **News Caching and Countdown:** The news fetching logic in `script.js` has been completely overhauled.
    *   News articles are now cached in `localStorage` for 10 hours.
    *   A countdown timer is displayed in the news window header, showing the user when the next update will be available.
    *   The `index.html` was updated to include a container for this timer.

3.  **Chat Auto-Cleanup:** The backend script `chat_backend.py` now includes an auto-cleanup mechanism.
    *   A new function, `clear_old_messages`, deletes messages older than 24 hours from the Supabase database.
    *   This function is triggered every time a new message is posted to the `/chat` endpoint, ensuring regular cleanup of the chat history.
