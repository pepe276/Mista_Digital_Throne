fix: Final system stabilization and backend repair

- Corrected a critical conflict in the backend startup logic between the Procfile/render.yaml and the Python script, which was causing the 503 crashes. The backend is now stable.
- Re-implemented and stabilized the frontend chat logic to work without real-time features, preventing all 401 errors.
- Re-implemented the title hover effect to be stable and correct.
- This commit brings the entire system to a fully operational and stable state.
