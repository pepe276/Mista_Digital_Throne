fix: Production hardening and final bug fixes

- Reconfigured the backend to use gunicorn as a process manager for uvicorn workers, which is the standard practice for FastAPI applications in production. This should resolve the 503 crashes.
- Cleaned up requirements.txt, removing unnecessary dependencies.
- Fixed the cursor layering issue by increasing its z-index to ensure it appears above all other elements.
- This is the final stabilization commit.
